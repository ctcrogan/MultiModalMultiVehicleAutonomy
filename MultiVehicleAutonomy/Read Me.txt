At the time of this writing nothing crashes when all systems are go. (10/9/2014)
Most common causes for crashes are:

	
	1. This software system is Multi-Threaded, So
	When testing seperate modules in the main function, bear in mind that commenting
	out certain modules will almost certainly have an effect on other modules.
	You must also comment out their shared variables, read the notes in the code.

	2. If something is not connected or connected to the wrong comport this will
	definitely crash the program. This includes the robots themselves. You need to
	be in the lab to test most code.

	3. Aria and/or OpenCv is not installed properly. Not properly Linking libraries

	4. Vision Algorithms run out of memory.
